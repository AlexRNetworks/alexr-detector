The build failed during the stage of 'building site' with a non-zero exit code of 2.
Solution:

The error code 2 commonly indicates that there is an issue with the build script.
To address this:
Check the build script to ensure there are no syntax errors or missing dependencies causing the non-zero exit code. Review any custom build commands or scripts that might be failing.
Verify that all build configurations are correctly set up for the framework being used.
